## Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making. The paper is accepted at CVPR 2025.

## Instructions
### Installation and Dataset
Please refer to the [Decision Transformer](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer) for installation instructions.

### Running 
To train the Decision SpikeFormer model on the D4RL dataset, run the following command:
```bash
./gym.sh
```
### Code 
The Decision SpikeFormer code is in the `gym/models/decision_spikeformer_pssa.py`.


## Ackownledgements
Our Decision SpikeFormer code is based on [Decision Transformer](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer)

## Limitations

In our architecture, the input needs to be processed by a fully connected layer before being fed into the model 
(Embedding Layer, ANN), 
and the output needs to be processed by another fully connected layer after the model(Prediction Head, ANN).
